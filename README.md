Robust Automatic Facial Expression Recognition
 A collection of scripts for implementation of a system for detecting facial expressions in images.
 
Working area for project implementing automatic facial expression recognition.

Using Tensorflow

Datasets are JAFEE and CK+

Work in progress...
 

# DataLoading
Files for loading data stored on the disk

# PreProcessing
Files for processing images. Using mainly opencv and numpy. This includes resizing, rescaling, edge detection and Color to Greyscale.

# FaceDetection
Extracting faces in the image. Mainly Harr Cascade Classifiers

# FeatureExtraction
Creating features from the extracted face. Identifying eyes, mouth, frequency domain transormations.

# Classificaiton
Classifying the emotion in the image using machine learning models.
